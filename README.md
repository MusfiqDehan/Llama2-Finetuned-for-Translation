## Task

**Chosen Task:**<br>
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) from Bengali to English Language<br><br>
**Why I choose it?**<br>
I am a native Bengali speaker and I have a good understanding of the English language. I have also worked on NMT before. So, I think it will be a good choice for me to work on this task.

## Dataset

I have used the [BUET-BanglaNMT Dataset](https://) from HuggingFace. It contains around 2.5 million pairs of Bengali and English sentences.

## Model

I have used the [Meta's Llama-2 Model](https://) from Meta. It is a transformer-based model that is pre-trained on a large corpus of Bengali and English sentences.
